I creadted this Notifier for my Home Assistant system so that various conditions could be announced even without internet access.
Such as water leaks or any other detectable problem. The secondary use was as an assistance call from sick person that was in bed.
The Sonoff Button is an ideal unit as it allows a single press, Double press or Long press, more than enough for that I needed.
I used the Super Mini ESP32-C3 and a DY-SV8F media player this allowed me to add enough files to announce anything I needed.
